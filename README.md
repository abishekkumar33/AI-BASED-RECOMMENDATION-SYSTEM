INTERN ID: CT06DH667

DOMAIN: JAVA PROGRAMMING

DURATION: 4 WEEKS

MENTOR: NEELA SANTHOSH KUMAR

DESCRIPTION:

Objective:

The objective of this task is to develop an AI-powered Recommendation System using Java and a specialized machine learning library—Apache Mahout. The goal is to create a console-based application that suggests relevant items or products to users based on their past preferences or behavior patterns. This simulation aims to give interns hands-on experience with collaborative filtering algorithms and Java-based AI development.

Project Overview:

Recommendation systems are at the core of major digital platforms today—whether it is YouTube recommending videos, Amazon suggesting products, or Netflix suggesting shows. This project focuses on user-based collaborative filtering, a technique that recommends items to a user based on the preferences of other users with similar tastes.

In this task, each user is associated with a set of item preferences stored in a .csv dataset file. The recommendation engine reads this data, computes user similarities using Pearson Correlation, identifies the nearest neighbors, and generates suggestions based on what similar users liked.

The application prompts the user to enter their User ID, and the engine will return a list of recommended item IDs with predicted preference scores, indicating how likely the user is to be interested in those items.

Technologies and Tools Used:

Java SE (Standard Edition): The primary programming language used to build the recommendation system.

Apache Mahout Library: A scalable machine learning library used for implementing recommendation engines, classification, and clustering.

File-Based DataModel: Used to load sample data from a CSV file containing user-item-preference triplets.

Development Environment:

IDE Used: Visual Studio Code

Java Version: Java SE 8+

Library: Apache Mahout (imported via .jar)

Execution: Compiled and run using javac and java commands via terminal.
